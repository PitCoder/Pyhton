The objective is to find the prime at a givenposition (x and y coordinates).

Constraints

N<=20

Each outputprime < 1000000

-130<x,y<130

Input Format

The first line has an integer N that specifies the number of coordinates in this test case

The next N lines each have a pair of comma separated integers, which are the x and y coordinates of the position

Output

The output consists of N lines.

Each consists of an integer specifying the prime at the corresponding position.

Test Case


Explanation

Example 1

Input

2

1,0

0,1

Output

3

7

Explanation

N=2. There are 2 sets of coordinates in this test case. The coordinates are (1,0) and (0,1).. The corresponding primes in the spiral are 3 and7. The output hence has these.

Example 2

Input

3

1,1

-1,1

-1,0

Output

5

11

13

Explanation

There are 3 sets of coordinates in this test case (N=3). The coordinates are (1,1),(-1,1) and (-1,0). The corresponding primes at these positions are 5, 11, 13. Hence the output has these in 3 lines.
